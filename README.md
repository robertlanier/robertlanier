I’m thriving in my current role, but always open to connecting about remote-first opportunities especially those aligned with ethical tech, AI-augmented workflows, creative automation, and async-friendly culture. I’m especially interested in globally distributed teams based on the West Coast US, Greater Vancouver, or Western and Central Europe.

Remote-first teams focused on:
